This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the Code tab above you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

public static boolean returnTrue() {

}

All you have to do is type return true; between the curly braces { } and then click the Check button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say SUBMIT FINAL. Click it and see what happens.
Notes

    If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
    If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.
