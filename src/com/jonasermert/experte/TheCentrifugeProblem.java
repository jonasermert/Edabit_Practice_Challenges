A centrifuge, as you probably know, is a laboratory device used to separate fluids based on density. The separation is achieved through centripetal force by spinning a collection of test tubes at high speeds. This means, the configuration needs to be in balance.

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments n and k and returns true if the configuration is balanced and false if it's not. To check out the formula, look at the resources tab.

The Centrifuge Problem with 6 Holes, n=6

Here are the valid configurations for n = 6, k = 2, 3, 4 and 6.
Examples

cFuge(6, 4) ➞ true

cFuge(2, 1) ➞ false

cFuge(3, 3) ➞ true

Notes

    One test tube k = 1 is never in balance.
    One hole n = 1 is never in balance, even empty.
